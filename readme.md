# The Mountain
This marks the beginning of my C programming mountain.

My goal here is to write a bunch of rock solid bricks that make the process of programming from scratch in C a lot more pleasant.

This repo is open sourced and in the public domain. Contributions, issues, and ideas would be amazing if you have the experience.
